# README

## Project Overview

This project provides an example of how to GradInv on the ML-100K dataset. Due to size limitations, we are currently only providing results for the ML-100K dataset. Future updates will include results for all datasets.

## Main Code

The main code is located in the `main.ipynb` file. This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the machine learning algorithms and their evaluation on the ML-100K dataset.

## Upcoming Updates

We plan to release the code for testing on all datasets on our GitHub repository. Stay tuned for updates!

## Required Libraries

To run the code, you will need the following libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
